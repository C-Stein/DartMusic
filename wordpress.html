<!-- I had to look around for ths opening tag. The code here seems 
to "get the header"-->

/*

Below is a basic archive template for WordPress.

1. Comment it to describe what the code is doing.
- done

2. Describe here what you would change, for semantics, for optimiation, or anything else.
- I'm not very familiar with WordPress and I don't know anything yet about best practices. My only suggestion would be to indent the if...thumbnail code block to make it more readable.

3. Assume each post has a custom field called "celebrity", to describe the celebrity the post was written about. Add the code needed to display the name of the celebrity with each post.
- using http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Custom_Fields,
http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/the_meta, and 
https://perishablepress.com/wordpress-custom-fields-tutorial/
I gave it my best shot on line 58

<!-- For each post in the loop the <article> has the id of the post-->
		<article id="post-<?php the_ID(); ?>" <?php post_class(); ?>>

if I were refactoring this code I would probably indent this line-line 38-->

<!-- Date and time seem pretty self explanitory, but I hada to look up the arguments they accept
time: Displays the time in the date format 'F j, Y' (ex: December 2, 2004), which could be used to replace the tag the_date().
time2: Displays the time using the format parameter string 'g:i a' (ex: 10:36 pm).-->

<!-- php_e translates text. The first argument (here, "Published by") is the text to be translated and the second argument is optional and represents the domain to retrieve the translated text. I had to double-check and make sure this literally meant translating to a different language, which it does, and which is really cool.
the_author_posts_link() Displays a link to all posts by an author.
-->
			<p class="author"><?php _e( 'Published by', 'custom' ); ?> <?php the_author_posts_link(); ?></p>

<!-- Displays an excerpt of the article, many details at https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/the_excerpt -->
			<?php the_excerpt(); ?>

<!-- This is where I'm trying to display the celebrity topic of the post. It's my understanding that the meta data is already entered in as a key/value pair and will display as an unordered list-->
